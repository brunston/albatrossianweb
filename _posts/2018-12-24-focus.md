Dear W.,

A few things about focus--distilling some common (and not-so-common) knowledge and backing it with studies and anecdotes. Goleman makes the argument that attention and learning to focus that attention is the 'hidden driver of excellence', so to speak. While not breakthrough, it was useful seeing the thread of 'focus' applied to other larger topics including context, systemic failures / management issues, pattern recognition, empathy, practice, and leadership.
