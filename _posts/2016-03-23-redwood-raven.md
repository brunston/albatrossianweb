Dear A.,

A raven followed me when I went adventuring through the redwoods. It flitted from branch to branch above my head, a lithe shadow singing litlting takk-takk-takks as I walked the forest floor. I could hear it over the brook and over the halfway heard conversations of other adventurers. It kept at it with resounding resolve, moving just ahead and rushing to catch up to me as it fell behind. I tried talking back, sending responding takk-takk-takks careening through the redwoods, but I doubt they made any sense to this determined bird. I wonder what it was trying to say. Perhaps it was more curious about the open bag of artichoke bread I had than it was about me.
